<h2>Checks of a survival data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform a set of consistency checks on survival data
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
survcheck(formula, data, subset, na.action, id, istate, istate0="(s0)", 
timefix=TRUE,...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>a model formula with a <code>Surv</code> object as the
response</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame in which to find the <code>id</code>,
<code>istate</code> and formula variables</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>
<p>expression indicating which subset of the rows of data
should be used in the fit.    All observations are included by default. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>

<p>a missing-data filter function.  This is applied to the model.frame
after any 
subset argument has been used.  Default is <code>options()\$na.action</code>.

<p>an identifier that labels unique subjects</p>

<td>
<p>an optional vector giving the current state at the start
of each interval</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>istate0</code></td>
<td>
<p>default label for the initial state of each subject (at
their first interval) when <code>istate</code> is missing</p>

<td>
<p>process times through the <code>aeqSurv</code> function to
eliminate potential roundoff issues.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This routine will examine a multi-state data set for consistency of
the data.  The basic rules are that if a subject is at risk they have
to be somewhere, can not be two states at once, and should make
sensible transitions from state to state.  It reports the number of
instances of the following conditions:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>overlap</dt><dd><p>two observations for the same subject that overlap in
time, e.g. intervals of (0, 100) and (90, 120).  
If <code>y</code> is simple (time, status) survival observation
intervals implicitly start at 0, so in that case any duplicate
identifiers will generate an overlap.</p>
</dd>
<dt>jump</dt><dd><p>a hole in a subject's timeline, where they are in one
state at the end of the prior interval, but a new state in the
at the start subsequent interval.</p>
</dd>
<dt>gap</dt><dd><p>one or more gaps in a subject's timeline; they are presumably
in the same state at their return as when they left.</p>
</dd>
<dt>teleport</dt><dd><p>two adjacent intervals for a subject, with the
first interval ending in one state and the subsequent interval
starting in another.  They have instantaneously changed states
with experiencing a transition.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The total number of occurences of each is present in the <code>flags</code>
vector. Optional components give the location and identifiers of the
flagged observations.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For data sets with time-dependent covariates, a given subject will often
have intermediate rows with a status of &lsquo;no event at this time&rsquo;.  (numeric
value of 0).
For instance a subject who started in state 1 at time 0, transitioned to state
2 at time 10, had a covariate <code>x</code> change from 135 to 156 at time
20, and a final transition to state 3 at time 30.
The response would be <code>Surv(c(0, 10, 20), c(10, 20, 30), c(2,0,3))</code>:
the status variable records <em>changes</em> in state, and there was no
change at time 20.
The <code>istate</code> variable would be (1, 2, 2); it contains the <em>current</em>
state, and so the value is unchanged when status = censored.
</p>
<p>Thus, when there are intermediate observations <code>istate</code> is not
simply a lagged version of the status, and may be more challenging to
create.
One approach is to let <code>survcheck</code> do the work: call it with
an <code>istate</code> argument that is correct for the first row of each
subject, or no <code>istate</code> argument at all, and then insert the
returned value into ones data frame.
