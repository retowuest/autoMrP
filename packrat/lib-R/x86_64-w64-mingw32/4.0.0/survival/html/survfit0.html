<h2>
Convert the format of a survfit object.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add the point for a starting time (time 0) to a survfit object's
elements.  This is useful for plotting.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
survfit0(x, start.time=0)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a survfit object</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>start.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>the desired starting time; see details below.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Survival curves are traditionally plotted forward from time 0, but
since the true starting time is not known as a part of the data,
the <code>survfit</code> routine does not include a time 0 value in
the resulting object.
Someone might look at cumulative mortgage defaults versus calendar
year, for instance, with the &lsquo;time&rsquo; value a Date object.
The plotted curve probably should not start at 0 = 1970/01/01.
(One could certainly argue that this behavior is overly pedantic, but
the decision was made over 20 years ago and it is far too late to
change it now.)
</p>
<p>This is a utility function used by <code>plot.survfit</code> and
<code>summary.survfit</code>.  If the original <code>survfit</code> call
included a <code>start.time</code> argument then that will be used as
the starting point, otherwise the default is 0.
It may be useful to others, so was exported.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a reformulated version of the object with an initial data point
at <code>start.time</code> added. 
The <code>time</code>, <code>surv</code>, <code>pstate</code>, <code>cumhaz</code>,
<code>std.err</code>, and <code>std.cumhaz</code> components will all be aliged,
so as to make plots and summaries easier to produce.
